        Generates a verbatim script for each concept using a constrained LLM.

        The core IP of this service lies in the detailed constraints placed upon
        the LLM to ensure a high-quality, production-ready script. The model is
        instructed to adhere to two fundamental rules:

        1.  **Verbatim Extraction**: The script must be constructed using only
            exact, word-for-word quotes from the provided transcript blocks.
            The LLM is not allowed to add, change, or summarize any text.
        2.  **Chronological Order**: The selected quotes must appear in the
            same chronological order as they do in the original transcript to
            maintain narrative integrity.

        The service returns the final script and a deconstructed list of the
        source chunks, which is essential for the downstream indexing services.

        Args:
            concepts_data: A list of concepts, each with a 'matched_blocks' key.
            blocks_data: A list of all available transcript blocks.
            llm_handler: An instance of the LLM handler for API communication.

        Returns:
            The concepts list, augmented with 'script' and 'script_chunks' keys.
