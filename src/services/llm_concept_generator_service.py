        Identifies compelling video concepts from transcript blocks.

        The core intellectual property of this service is its methodology for defining
        a "video concept." Rather than just extracting a topic, it structures each 
        concept with three key components:
        
        1.  A short, click-worthy **title**.
        2.  A one-sentence **logline** that captures the unique "angle" of the story.
        3.  An identified **narrative structure** (e.g., "Problem -> Solution") that
            is inherent in the content for that angle.

        This structured approach provides crucial creative direction for the subsequent
        services in the pipeline.

        Args:
            blocks_data: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents
                         a semantic block of the transcript.
            llm_handler: An instance of the LLM handler for API communication.
            num_concepts: The desired number of concepts to generate.

        Returns:
            A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a
            fully-formed video concept.
