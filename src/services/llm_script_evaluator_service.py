        Performs a structured evaluation of a script's quality.

        The core IP of this service is the detailed, research-backed rubric
        against which the script is scored. The rubric includes multiple criteria
        assessing factors such as:
        - Hook Quality and Effectiveness
        - Narrative Cohesion and Clarity
        - Emotional Impact and Payoff
        - Overall Viral Potential

        The LLM is prompted to act as an expert viral video strategist, providing
        a score and detailed justification for each criterion.

        Args:
            script_text: The generated script to be evaluated.
            long_form_summary: A summary of the original video for context.
            llm_handler: An instance of the LLM handler for API communication.

            A dictionary containing the detailed evaluation results, or None on failure.
