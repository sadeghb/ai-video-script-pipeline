        Generates a structured list of recommendations for script improvement.

        The core IP of this service is its sophisticated multi-context prompting
        strategy. The LLM is provided with a comprehensive set of documents:
        - The original script to be improved.
        - The video's creative concept (title and logline).
        - A summary of the source material.
        - The detailed, structured evaluation report from the "Critic" service.
        - The proprietary rubric that was used to score the script.

        By analyzing all these inputs together, the LLM can generate highly relevant
        and actionable feedback that is grounded in the initial evaluation.

        Args:
            script_text: The generated script to be improved.
            evaluation_result: The structured evaluation from the LlmScriptEvaluatorService.
            long_form_summary: A summary of the original video for context.
            concept: The original concept dictionary for the script.
            llm_handler: An instance of the LLM handler for API communication.

        Returns:
            A dictionary containing a list of recommendations, or None on failure.
